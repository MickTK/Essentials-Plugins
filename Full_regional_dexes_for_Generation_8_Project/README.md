# Full regional dexes for Generation 8 Project
Add full regional dexes (up to generation 8) to the game.

To make it work replace the file 'PBS/regional_dexes.txt' with the one in this folder.

Note: make sure to have all the maps in `PBS/town_map.txt` with the correct index or the game will throw an exception because it can't find the map. The file should look like the one in this folder.
